## Harmonic mean

#The harmonic mean is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal of the data. That is
#used to average ratio data

harmonic_mean(x)=1/arithmetic_mean(1/x)

#The harmonic mean is often used to average ratio data. 

#You'll be using it on the price/earnings ratio of stocks in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, provided as std_and_poor500. 
#Price/earnings ratio is a measure of how expensive a stock is.

#The dplyr package is loaded:
library(dplyr)

#lets write harmonic mean function, and use it on standards and poor data

# Look at the Standard and Poor 500 data
