--Inner Join

-- Inner join the cities table on the left to the countries table on the right, keeping all of the fields in both tables.

SELECT * 
FROM cities
  -- Inner join to countries
  INNER JOIN countries
    -- Match on the country codes
    ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
    
-- Select name fields (with alias) and region 
SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, region
FROM cities
  INNER JOIN countries
    ON cities.country_code = countries.code;
    
--Instead of writing the full table name, you can use table aliasing as a shortcut. 
--For tables you also use AS to add the alias immediately after the table name with a space. Check out the aliasing of cities and countries below.

--SELECT c1.name AS city, c2.name AS country
--FROM cities AS c1
--INNER JOIN countries AS c2
--ON c1.country_code = c2.code;
